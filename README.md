**For UNICEF Evaluation:** These interactive demos demonstrate Sigma-ALS versatility across two African educational sectors and showcase potential impact. Each demo represents real-world implementations tested with educators and learners in Uganda and South Africa. They will require validation with larger samples in comprehensive pilot projects. 

**Next Steps:** 
- Scale pilots to demonstrations to full MVP deployment
- Integrate with existing educational infrastructure
- Expand language support based on regional requirements
- Develop comprehensive training materials for educators
